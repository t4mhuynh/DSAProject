# DSAProject
Data Structures and Algorithm Project that is sorting the list of the courses in the Computer Science program in alphanumeric order.

#What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

In this course, I worked on two projects that aimed to teach me about data structures and algorithms. In Project One, I analyzed the run-time and memory usage of different data structures, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. In Project Two, I implemented a sorting algorithm to sort and print out a list of courses in the Computer Science program in alphanumeric order.

The problem I was solving in these projects was understanding the importance of data structures and algorithms in software development. Data structures are essential for storing and organizing data in a way that makes it easy to access and manipulate, while algorithms are critical for performing operations on that data efficiently. In both projects, I had to consider which data structure would be best suited for the task at hand and how to optimize the algorithm to minimize run-time and memory usage.

#How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

To approach these problems, I first researched and studied the different data structures and algorithms available. I then implemented and tested them to see how they performed under various conditions. Throughout the process, I learned about the trade-offs between different data structures and algorithms and how to choose the best one for a given problem. Understanding data structures is crucial in software development because it helps developers optimize the performance of their programs.

#How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

While working on these projects, I encountered several roadblocks, such as debugging errors and optimizing the performance of the algorithms. To overcome these obstacles, I consulted documentation, forums, and peers to help me better understand the problems and find effective solutions. I also worked on breaking down the problems into smaller, more manageable tasks, and systematically tested and refined my code until I achieved the desired results.



#How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

Working on these projects has expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs. I now consider data structures and algorithms as a crucial part of software development and ensure that I choose the right ones for each problem I encounter. Additionally, I have learned how to analyze and optimize the performance of my code, which helps me design efficient and effective software.



#How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Finally, my work on these projects has evolved the way I write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable. By carefully choosing the appropriate data structures and algorithms, I can ensure that my code is easily understandable and maintainable by other developers. Additionally, I have learned to break down problems into smaller, more manageable pieces, which makes my code more adaptable and allows for future modifications without significant rewrites. Overall, these projects have been instrumental in developing my skills as a software developer and have helped me understand the importance of data structures and algorithms in software development.

Pseudocode for loading data into the vector data structure:

1.	Define an empty vector data structure called "courses"
2.	Open the "Course Information" file
3.	Read the first line of the file
4.	Use a while loop to iterate through each line of the file
5.	Within the while loop, use a try-catch block to check for file format errors
a. Ensure there are at least two parameters on each line
b. Ensure any prerequisite that is provided on a line exists as a course in the file
6.	If there are no file format errors, parse each line and store the course number, title, and prerequisites in variables
7.	Create a new course object using the variables from step 6
8.	Store the course object in the "courses" vector data structure
9.	Read the next line of the file
10.	Repeat steps 5-9 until the end of the file is reached


Pseudocode for searching the data structure for a specific course and printing out course information and prerequisites:

1.	Define a variable called "searchCourse" and prompt the user to input the course number they want to search for
2.	Use a for loop to iterate through the "courses" vector data structure
3.	Within the for loop, use an if statement to check if the course number of the current course object in the vector data structure matches the "searchCourse" variable
4.	If the course number matches, print out the course information (course number, title, prerequisites)
5.	If the course number does not match, move to the next object in the vector data structure
6.	Repeat steps 3-5 until the end of the vector data structure is reached
7.	If the course is not found, display "Course not found" to the user.
